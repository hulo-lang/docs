## Overview

Hulo's analyzer adopts a layered architecture design, building upon ANTLR4-generated lexical and syntax analyzers, with an additional custom analysis layer to handle complex syntax features.

## ANTLR4 Introduction

ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks.

### Core Features
- **Grammar-Driven**: Automatically generates parsers from grammar definitions
- **Multi-Target Support**: Supports multiple target languages including Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, and more
- **Powerful Grammar Expression**: Supports complex grammar rules and semantic actions
- **Rich Toolchain**: Provides grammar visualization, debugging, testing, and other tools
- **Active Community**: Large user community with extensive documentation and resources

### How It Works
1. **Grammar Definition**: Define language rules using ANTLR grammar files (.g4)
2. **Code Generation**: ANTLR generates lexical and syntax analyzers based on grammar files
3. **Parse Tree Construction**: Generated parsers convert input text into parse trees
4. **Visitor Pattern**: Provides Listener and Visitor interfaces for traversing and processing parse trees

## Why Choose ANTLR4

### Reasons for Choice
- **Syntax Complexity**: Hulo's syntax is relatively complex, and building a parser from scratch would consume significant effort
- **Development Efficiency**: Focus on language implementation rather than parser construction, enabling rapid validation of language design
- **Maturity and Stability**: ANTLR4 is an industry-standard parser generator with rich toolchain support
- **Powerful Grammar Expression**: Supports complex syntax features such as left recursion, semantic predicates, etc.

### Challenges Faced
- **Node Control Difficulties**: ANTLR-generated AST node operations are less flexible than hand-written parsers
- **Customization Limitations**: Difficulty in precisely controlling AST structure and node types
- **Performance Overhead**: Generated code may be less efficient than hand-written parsers
- **Learning Curve**: Requires mastering ANTLR grammar definition and tool usage

## Layered Architecture Design

### Layer 1: ANTLR4 Generated Layer
```
Source Code → Token → ANTLR AST
```

- **Lexer**: Converts source code character stream into token stream
- **Parser**: Converts token stream into ANTLR syntax tree
- **Token**: Lexical units containing type, value, position, and context information

### Layer 2: Hulo Analysis Layer
```
ANTLR AST → Hulo AST
```

- **Analyzer**: Converts ANTLR AST to Hulo's custom AST
- **Tracer**: Records AST conversion call chains for debugging and optimization

## Core Components

### Token
Basic unit of lexical analysis, containing:
- Type (keywords, identifiers, literals, etc.)
- Value (specific string or numeric value)
- Position information (line number, column number)
- Context information

### Lexer (Lexical Analyzer)
- Identifies keywords, identifiers, literals, operators
- Handles comments, whitespace, line breaks
- Generates token stream for syntax analyzer

### Parser (Syntax Analyzer)
- Validates syntax structure correctness
- Builds ANTLR syntax tree
- Handles syntax errors and recovery

### Analyzer (Hulo Analyzer)
- Converts ANTLR AST to Hulo AST
- Handles complex semantic analysis
- Type checking and type inference
- Scope analysis

### Tracer
- Records complete AST conversion call chains
- Provides detailed debugging information
- Performance analysis and optimization suggestions

## Design Advantages

### Development Efficiency
- Rapid implementation of complex syntax features
- Focus on language design and semantic analysis
- Reduced parser-related bugs

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Easy testing and debugging
- Simple extension of new features

### Flexibility
- Custom AST structure
- Precise control over node types
- Support for complex semantic analysis

## Future Plans

As the project evolves, we may consider:
- Gradually replacing ANTLR with hand-written parsers
- Optimizing AST conversion performance
- Enhancing error handling and recovery mechanisms
