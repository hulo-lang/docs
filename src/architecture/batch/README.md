Considering the bad writing method and origin shortcoming of batch, hulo will transform into batches of which syntax is based on [FreakC](https://github.com/FreakC-Foundation/FreakC) when translating, and thereby translate batches into batch.

But, hulo can directly compile to batch compared to amber.
```cmd
hulo build . -o batch
```
