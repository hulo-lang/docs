Welcome to the Hulo programming language documentation! ðŸŽ‰

Hulo is a cross-platform scripting language that compiles your code into scripts for multiple target platforms, including Bash, PowerShell, VBScript, and more.

## Quick Start

Here's a simple Hello World example:

```hulo title="main.hl"
echo "Hello World"
```

Run `hulo main.hl`, and it will compile to:

### Bash Version
```sh
echo "Hello World"
```

### VBScript Version
```vb
Set shell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
shell.Exec("cmd.exe /c echo ""Hello, World!""")
```

### PowerShell Version
```powershell
Write-Host "Hello World"
```

## Key Features

- **Cross-platform compilation**: Write once, run anywhere
- **Easy to learn**: Simple syntax with low learning curve
- **Rich standard library**: Built-in utilities and functions
- **Type system**: Compile-time static type checking for safety and efficiency
